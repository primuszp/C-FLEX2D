# C-FLEX2D
2D Axisymmetric Finite Element Methods (FEM) Program for Flexible Pavement Analysis. 

The program is developed by Haohang Huang and Jiayi Luo @ University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The advisor is [Professor Erol Tutumluer](https://cee.illinois.edu/directory/profile/tutumlue).

The development of this software program is sponsored by [Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil), United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The ERDC project manager is [Jeb S. Tingle](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Images/igphoto/2002117275/).

The program name represents Corps of Engineers ("**C**") and Flexible pavements ("**FLEX**").

The code is in C++ and Python. 2D FEM engine is written in C++. Other related modules, extensions, and Graphical User Interface (GUI) are written in Python.
